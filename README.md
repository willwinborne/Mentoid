This is a "Dating app" used to find a mentor for yourself. We use node, express, express-session, and multer to help us. See the entity relationship diagram to set up a Mentoid MySQL database.

Functionality:
- Login with sitewide sessions
- Create new profile as a mentor or mentee
- Edit profile
- "Match" screen allowing a mentee to select a mentor (based on interests)
- Chat (and view details) with mentor or mentee
- Manage your matches to associate with people you like

All serverside code is contained in express.js.
